# OpenVSCode Server on PipeOps

This example is for the [OpenVSCode Server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server), a version of VS Code that runs a server on a remote machine and allows access through a modern web browser. It's based on the very same architecture used by [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com) at scale.
